# RLLUT
Tool used to help configure laptops for doctors' rounds. Uses a database to get most of the info.

The Rounding Laptop Lookup Tool is used to help configure laptops used by doctors doing their rounds in the clinic. The tool gathers inormation about the default printer to install, the timezone of the clinic, the Organizational Group (OG) it belongs to, as well as information on the Helmer refridgerator(s) in the clinic. It also has a button to show where the clinic is located in Google maps.

This information is useless to the general public. The app is more just a demonstration of one of the small tools I built for the company I worked for. The SQL Server database has been tranferred to a SQLite database so you can test it locally. No proprietary company information is located in the database.

The database needs to be in the same directory as the python file.
